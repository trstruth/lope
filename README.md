Lope is your friendly terminal-based companion for improving workflow efficiency when tackling programming tasks. It’s designed from the ground up to give you intuitive access to tools and features that help you focus on the code, not the clutter.

Effortlessly browse files, manipulate prompt text, and send rich queries to integrated services—right from within the terminal! Think of it as an interactive control hub that feels smooth, minimal, and surprisingly capable.

## Installation

Lope is written in Rust, so installing it is straightforward if you have the Rust toolchain set up on your machine. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. Install a recent version of Cargo (it comes with Rust).

3. An OpenAI API key: Lope utilizes OpenAI services for certain features and will require your token file to be available at `~/.sgpt/token`.

### Build & Install
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd lope
   ```

2. Build and install the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo install --path .
   ```

This will compile the application and place the binary in your Cargo binary directory (e.g., `~/.cargo/bin`).

## Usage

Once installed, you can invoke Lope from your terminal simply by typing:

```bash
lope
```

When you run Lope, you'll enter a terminal-based app with the following key features:

### Key Features
- **File Browser**: Easily navigate through your project file structure.
- **Prompt Editor**: Write or refine prompts directly in the terminal.
- **Options & Actions**: Send your inputs to peripheral services or exit if you're done.

### Controls
Here are some of the key bindings to get you navigating like a pro:
- **Switch Widgets**: Use `Ctrl+h` or `Ctrl+l` to cycle between panels.
- **File Navigation**: Browse your file structure using `j` to move down, `k` to move up, and toggle folder expansion with `h` and `l`.
- **Edit Prompts**: Enter text normally in the editor, and use `Backspace` to delete as needed.
- **Send Query**: Invoke actions like sending prompts to external APIs by selecting options.
- **Quit**: Choose to exit with configurable termination options.

## Environment Setup
Lope requires an OpenAI API token to function fully. Please ensure you have placed a valid token in the following location:

```plaintext
~/.sgpt/token
```

The file should contain only the token string. Ensure it's secured and not world-readable.
